# schema.yaml
#
# This file defines the data schema for the wine quality dataset.
# It provides information about column data types and identifies the target variable.
# This schema is used for data validation and preprocessing in the ML pipeline.

# Column specifications
# Each column is mapped to its expected data type to ensure data consistency
COLUMNS:
  fixed acidity: float64          # Acidity from non-volatile acids
  volatile acidity: float64       # Acidity from volatile acids like acetic acid
  citric acid: float64            # Citric acid content in g/L
  residual sugar: float64         # Amount of sugar remaining after fermentation in g/L
  chlorides: float64              # Salt content in g/L
  free sulfur dioxide: float64    # Free form of SO2 in mg/L
  total sulfur dioxide: float64   # Total SO2 in mg/L (free + bound forms)
  density: float64                # Density of the wine in g/cmÂ³
  pH: float64                     # Acidity/alkalinity scale (0-14)
  sulphates: float64              # Potassium sulphate content in g/L
  alcohol: float64                # Alcohol content by volume in %
  quality: int64                  # Target variable - wine quality score (0-10)

# Target column specification
# Identifies which column is the prediction target for the ML model
TARGET_COLUMN:
  name: quality                   # The column to be predicted by the model
